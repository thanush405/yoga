Energy is a place where the trainers all know your name. Where friendships are forged in sweat. Where you get home late not because the class ran long, but because you were laughing with friends after.

We’re not just yoga, not just pilates, not just cardio, we’re a full-service fitness studio. Everything you need, under one roof.

We’re ridiculously fun, too. You’ll never have to endure a boring workout again.

			<h3>HELLO WORLD!</h3>
			<p>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.Exercising for fitness means that in addition to conditioning the heart, lungs, and circulatory system, you work all the major muscles of the body.The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individual's mind, body and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and body tone.</p>
